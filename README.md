## How to install

In order to use our Frontend applications with your Wordpress CMS, you need to have it installed locally on your device.

If you haven't installed Wordpress locally you can do it here [https://wordpress.org/support/article/how-to-install-wordpress/]

This connection makes it possible for any locally stored Wordpress posts to be rendered in our Frontend Applications.
